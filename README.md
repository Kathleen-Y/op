Unit 10 OOP  Employee Summary
### In this homework assignment, your challenge is to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:
``

# Use the Inquirer npm package to prompt the user for their email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company. For instance, an intern may provide their school, whereas an engineer may provide their GitHub username.
